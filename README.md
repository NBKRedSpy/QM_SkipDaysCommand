# Quasimorph SkipDaysCommand

![thumbnail icon](media/thumbnail.png)


A debugging utility to skip the in game's time by X number of days.
Can only be run while a game is loaded and is in space.

Usage: `skip-days 30'

Use `skip-days` or the alias `sd`

The mod will log the process to the Player.log.

# Notes

For visual feedback, the `sandbox` can be open while time is being processed.  The sandbox does not have much of a performance impact.

For slightly faster processing, keep the sandbox screen disabled keep the console open.  The latter will prevent the ship's orbit from animating.
