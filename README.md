# Quasimorph Fast Forward Time

![thumbnail icon](media/thumbnail.png)

A debugging utility to fast forward the game's time by X number of days or hours, as quickly as the game can process.
Can only be run while a game is loaded and is in space.

Usage: 

`skip-days 30'
`skip-days 8h'

The mod will log the process to the Player.log.

# Notes

For visual feedback, the `sandbox` can be open while time is being processed.  The sandbox does not have much of a performance impact.

For slightly faster processing keep the console open and do not show the sandbox screen.
