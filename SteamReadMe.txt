[h1]Quasimorph SkipDaysCommand[/h1]


A debugging utility to skip the in game's time by X number of days.
Can only be run while a game is loaded and is in space.

Usage: `skip-days 30'

Use [i]skip-days[/i] or the alias [i]sd[/i]

The mod will log the process to the Player.log.

[h1]Notes[/h1]

For visual feedback, the [i]sandbox[/i] can be open while time is being processed.  The sandbox does not have much of a performance impact.

For slightly faster processing, keep the sandbox screen disabled keep the console open.  The latter will prevent the ship's orbit from animating.
