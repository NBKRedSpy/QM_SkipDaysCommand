[h1]Quasimorph Fast Forward Time[/h1]


A debugging utility to fast forward the game's time by X number of days or hours, as quickly as the game can process.
Can only be run while a game is loaded and is in space.

Usage:

[i]skip-days 30' [/i]skip-days 8h'

The mod will log the process to the Player.log.

[h1]Notes[/h1]

For visual feedback, the [i]sandbox[/i] can be open while time is being processed.  The sandbox does not have much of a performance impact.

For slightly faster processing keep the console open and do not show the sandbox screen.
